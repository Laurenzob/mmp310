        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>My name is Laurenzo Brown, I'm from Queens New York and lived here my whole life so far. Plan on exploring the world as life goes on and become a graphic designer. I have 2 siblings, a younger brother and older sister. I spend most of my personal time sleeping, reading, working out, or playing video games. I'm excited to learn what this class has to teach me and continue my growing understanding of programming.Click on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/l_mcb13">this link</a> to follow me on instagram :] </p>
